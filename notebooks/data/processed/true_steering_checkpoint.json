Let's discuss the key differences between an HMO and a PPO plan:\n   - HMO (Health Maintenance Organization): This type of plan typically requires you to choose a primary care physician (PCP) who manages your overall healthcare needs. You'll need to get a referral from your PCP to see a specialist. This can help control costs by ensuring that care is coordinated.\n   - PPO (Preferred Provider Organization): With a PPO plan, you don't need to choose a PCP, and you can visit specialists directly without a referral. This can offer more flexibility, but it may come with higher out-of-pocket",
